# Discord Caravan Bot

A [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot ðŸ¤– for managing [PokÃ©mon GO](https://www.pokemongo.com/) raid caravans.

> Status: **Useful!**


## Usage

Set your secret discord bot token, then run `caravan_bot` via
[pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/).

    export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN
    pipenv run python -m caravan_bot <ARGS>

All options:

```
  caravan_bot --gyms=JSON [--server-filter=REGEX] [--channel-filter=REGEX]
  caravan_bot (-h | --help)
  caravan_bot --version

Options:
  -h --help                 Show this screen.
  --version                 Show version.
  --gyms=JSON               JSON file containing gyms names, coordinates, and
                            optional aliases.
  --server-filter=REGEX     Restrict bot to servers matching this pattern
                            [default: .*].
  --channel-filter=REGEX    Restrict bot to channels matching this pattern
                            [default: .*caravan.*].
```

## Docker Usage

First, ensure that you have a `gyms.json` file in the appropriate format at the
root of the project. Then:

    export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN
    docker-compose run -e DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="${DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN}" --rm caravan_bot <args> 

Where `<args>` are the same, minus the `--gyms` option since that's already mounted into the container.

If you change the gyms, restart the container. If you change the code, restart
the container after running:

    docker-compose build


## Contributing

Create a bot and server for testing:

1. Create a "Caravan" app in discord.
2. In the app, create a "Caravan Bot" bot.
3. Create a personal Discord server just for bot testing.
4. Paste this link into your browser, with your app's client ID in place of `YOUR_CLIENT_ID`:

        https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=268528640&scope=bot

    Authorize the bot to access your bot testing server.


Set up your development environment:

1. Install Python 3.7.
2. Clone this repository (or your own fork of it).
3. Install project dependencies with [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/)

        pipenv install --dev


### Design Goals

- similar interface to [Meowth 2.0](https://github.com/FoglyOgly/Meowth)
- bot state should be stored purely in Discord


### Roadmap

- [X] skeleton Discord bot project
- [X] at bot startup, pin a welcome message to each caravan channel
- [X] on caravan channel creation, pin a welcome message to the new channel
- [X] in response to posted itinerary, update pinned message with Google Maps route
- [X] in response to posted itinerary, update pinned message with list of stops
- [X] switch pinned message to "embeds" for better formatting
- [X] allow admins to delegate caravan leaders
- [X] restrict route setting to leaders
- [X] introduce caravan modes: allow leaders to start/stop caravan
- [X] allow leaders to advance caravan (`!next` and `!skip [reason]`)
- [X] allow leaders to add a new next stop while in active mode
- [X] cache pins
- [X] add help
- [X] disallow duplicate stops
- [X] `!remove`/`!delete` command to skip gym by name
- [X] allow anyone to `!join` the caravan, optionally with guests
- [X] allow members to `!leave` the caravan
- [X] warn when the attendance nears 20 for any individual gym
- [X] lots of unit tests
- [X] Docker Compose runner
- [ ] allow caravan members to restrict their attendance to partial routes
- [ ] when the caravan is active, allow members to signal `!here`
- [ ] allow leaders to `!lobby`
- [ ] allow members to query the `!here` statuses with `!list`
- [ ] take gym distance into consideration when ranking gym name matches
- [ ] allow leaders to register start/stop times
- [ ] notify members one hour prior to the caravan starting of the start time and starting location
- [ ] automatically start/stop the caravan at the expected times
